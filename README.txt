A design which uses different processes to copy the contents of different directories cannot easily detect hard links. This is primarily due to the inability to seamlessly determine which file is the original, and which is the hard link, as although they will have distinct inode numbers, they are referenced by the same name. Often, hard links can result in the creation of unwanted looping behaviour within a directory tree structure. When utilizing multiple processes, this can make it challenging for children to accurately identify their original parent. As a result, we should avoid hard links in this design.
